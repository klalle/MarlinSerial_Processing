# Processing code for MPCNC-router
This is a small program that lets u use the keyboard arrows to move the mpcnc. this is just an example, processing is easy to configure for using a joystick, voice controll or whatever ;)

## Processing
Download Processing from here: [Processing download page](https://processing.org/download/)

#### Use:<br>
* Wait 15 sec after program is run to let the marlin start and get redy
* if nothing happens when pressing arrows - make sure the little gray running window is active (pops up when starting the program)
* left = -1mm X
* right = 1mm X
* Up = 1mm Y
* Down = -1mm Y
* z = change up/down to Z instead of Y
* y = change back from Z to Y on up/down arrows
These settings are just to show its working - change to serve your needs in the code!
  
Hope someone find this useful!
